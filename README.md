# 📝 Text Recognition from Images (Multi-Language Support)

A powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project that extracts text from images with multi-language support. This project leverages **Tesseract-OCR**, **OpenCV**, and **Python** to enhance accuracy and handle various text-based image processing challenges.

## 🚀 Features
- 🌍 **Multi-Language Support**: Extracts text from images in multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Japanese, etc.).
- 🔍 **Pre-Processing for Better Accuracy**: Handles noisy, distorted, or low-resolution images using image processing techniques.
- 🖼️ **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays processed images and highlights recognized text.
- ⚡ **Batch Processing**: Recognize text from multiple images at once.
- 📜 **Custom Language Training**: Allows adding new language support using Tesseract training data.
- 🎭 **Handwriting Recognition**: Detects handwritten text in addition to printed characters.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Tesseract-OCR** - OCR Engine for text recognition
- **OpenCV** - Image processing and enhancement
- **Pillow (PIL)** - Image handling and manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development and visualization
