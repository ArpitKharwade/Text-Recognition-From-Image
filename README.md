# Text Recognition from Images (Multi-Language Support)  

This project leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images, supporting multiple languages. Built using Python, it employs image pre-processing and OCR techniques to ensure accuracy and versatility.  

## Features  
- Extracts text from images in **multiple languages** (e.g., English, Hindi, Japanese etc.).  
- Handles noisy or distorted images with pre-processing steps.  
- Visualizes processed images and recognize text from it.


## Technologies  
- **Python Libraries:**  PyTesseract, OpenCV, PIL, Jupyter Notebook 
- **OCR Engine:** Tesseract-OCR with language packs.
